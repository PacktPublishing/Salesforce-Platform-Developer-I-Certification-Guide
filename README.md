## Errata
Page 286, para 1: In this class, I defined only a string to demonstrate the usability of the abstract class:
```
public Movie(String sMovieType){
    this.movieType = sMovieType;
}
```
_Should be_
```
public Movie(Id idMovieId){
    this.movieId = idMovieId;
}
```

Page 285, last para: Like any other class, we give the class a name:
```
private String movieType = '';
```
_Should be_
```
private Id movieId = null;
```
